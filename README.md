# Weather Report

## Description

Build a Ruby application to pull data from multiple Weather Underground API endpoints and present a weather report to the user.

I later came back and added a user interface, so that I could use this as a portfolio piece.

## How To Use

* Enter a valid u.s. zipcode.
